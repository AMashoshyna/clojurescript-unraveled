### Vars

_ClojureScript_ is a mostly functional language that focuses on
immutability. Because of that, it does not have the concept of variables as you know
them in most other programming languages. The closest analogy to variables are the
variables you define in algebra; when you say `x = 6` in mathematics, you are saying
that you want the symbol `x` to stand for the number six.

In _ClojureScript_, vars are represented by symbols and store a single value
together with metadata.

You can define a var using the `def` special form:

[source, clojure]
----
(def x 22)
(def y [1 2 3])
----

Vars are always top level in the namespace which we will
explain later. If you use `def` in a function call, the var will be defined at
the namespace level, but we do not recommend this - instead, you should use `let` to
define variables within a function.
